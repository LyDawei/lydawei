    <h2 class="astro-KH7BTL4R">My Story</h2>
    <p class="astro-KH7BTL4R">I'm David Ly — a senior full-stack developer who builds pragmatic systems designed to last. I focus on clarity, maintainability, and writing code that actually works when it matters. With over a decade of experience across mobile, web, and game development, I care more about shipping thoughtful solutions than chasing clever abstractions.</p>

    <p class="astro-KH7BTL4R">You might've seen the handle Lydawei floating around. It's more than just a username — it's my Chinese name (李大衛), and also a quiet play on the phrase "lead the way." That's who I aspire to be: someone who leads thoughtfully. Over the years, I've learned from bad leaders, harsh leaders, and truly great ones — and those experiences shaped my belief that leadership can be quiet, deliberate, and human.</p>

    <p class="astro-KH7BTL4R">I don't do traditional whiteboard interviews — not because I can't, but because I believe strong engineering is best demonstrated through real code, sound decisions, and collaborative problem-solving. I'm all for working through tough problems live — as long as it's a conversation, not an ego check.</p>

    <p class="astro-KH7BTL4R">Outside of work, I'm raising two kids, developing a psychological platformer in Godot, and exploring storytelling through art and memory.</p>
